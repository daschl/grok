grok
====
The `grok` library allows you to quickly parse and match potentially unstructured data into a structed result. It is especially helpful when parsing logfiles of all kinds. This [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) version is mainly a port from the [java version](https://github.com/thekrakken/java-grok) which in turn drew inspiration from the original [ruby version](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-grok).

## Usage
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
grok = "2.0"
```

Here is a simple example which stores a pattern, compiles it and then matches a line on it:

```rust
use grok::Grok;

fn main() {
    // Instantiate Grok
    let mut grok = Grok::default();

    // Add a pattern which might be a regex or an alias
    grok.add_pattern("USERNAME", r"[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+");

    // Compile the definitions into the pattern you want
    let pattern = grok
        .compile("%{USERNAME}", false)
        .expect("Error while compiling!");

    //  Match the compiled pattern against a string
    match pattern.match_against("root") {
        Some(m) => println!("Found username {:?}", m.get("USERNAME")),
        None => println!("No matches found!"),
    }
}
```

Note that compiling the pattern is an expensive operation, so very similar to plain regex handling the `compile`
operation should be performed once and then the `match_against` method on the pattern can be called repeatedly
in a loop or iterator. The returned pattern is not bound to the lifetime of the original grok instance so it can
be passed freely around. For performance reasons the `Match` returned is bound to the pattern lifetime so keep
them close together or clone/copy out the containing results as needed.

## Further Information
This library depends on [onig](https://crates.io/crates/onig) for its regex execution, which itself is a Rust binding for the powerful [Oniguruma](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma) regex library. If in doubt why a specific regex doesn't work, this is the best place to look for more information what patterns are supported and how to use advanced features.
