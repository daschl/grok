# Change Log

All user visible changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), as described
for Rust libraries in [RFC #1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md)

## In Progress (2.0.0)

 * Minimum Rust version is `1.56`, Rust Edition switched to 2021.
 * (breaking) Rename `Grok::with_patterns()` to `Grok::with_default_patterns()`.
 * (breaking) Rename `Grok::insert_definition` to `Grok::add_pattern` to stop mixing "definition" with "pattern".
 * (breaking) `Matches::iter()` is now only returning the matches and not also the other patters with an empty string as the value.
 * Updated `onig` to `6.3`.
 * `master` branch is now called `main`.
 * Add `IntoIter` for `&Matches` for more convenient match iteration (i.e. for loop).

## [1.2.0] - 2021-03-21

 * Updated `onig` to `6.1`.
 * Allow to inspect the default built patterns. Thanks @magodo!
 * Use the non_exhaustive attribute on `Error` as suggested by clippy.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-10-31

 * Use `Regex::foreach_names` instead of `Regex::capture_names` to work on 32 bit platforms. Thanks @a-rodin! 

## [1.1.0] - 2019-10-30

 * Updated `onig` to `5.0`.
 * Use `Regex::foreach_names` instead of `Regex::capture_names` to work on 32 bit platforms. Thanks @a-rodin! 

## [1.0.0] - 2019-03-28

 * Updated `onig` to `4.3`.

## [0.5.0] - 2018-02-19

 * Updated `onig` to `3.1`.

## [0.4.1] - 2017-11-15

 * Fixed a bug where the named pattern on compilation is also accessible from the iterator.

## [0.4.0] - 2017-11-15

 * Allow to specify named patterns when compiling, without inserting the definition beforehand.

## [0.3.0] - 2017-09-13

 * `regex` has been switched to `onig` so we have full compatibility with all the other grok patterns.
 * Added `Grok::with_patterns()` which loads all the default patterns. `Grok::defalt()` also uses that now.
 * `iter()` is available on `Matches` which yields a `(&str, &str)` kv pair of match/result.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-06

 * Instead of panicing, all methods that could return a `Result<T, grok::Error>`.
 * `Grok::new()` has been renamed to `Grok::empty()` (or `Grok::default()`)
 * `is_empty()` is available in the `Matches` API to check if there are matches at all.
 * `len()` is available in the `Matches` API to get the total number of matches.

## 0.1.0 - 2017-09-05

 * Initial Release
